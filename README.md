[Apache CXF](https://cxf.apache.org/) demo project showcasing the configuration of an app using SpringBoot3, Gradle, Kotlin 2, and Jakarta.

Start the app via
```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

To trigger the `hello` function send a GET http://localhost:8080/services/rs/hello
(If you use IntelliJ you can use its http client capability from the file test-requests.http)
